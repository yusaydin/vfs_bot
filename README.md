VFS Global Appointment Booking Bot
This project is an automated bot designed to simplify and streamline the process of booking appointments on the VFS Global website. The bot automates repetitive tasks, reducing the time required for users to secure their desired appointment slots.

Features
Automated Login: Securely logs into the VFS Global website with user credentials.
Appointment Search: Checks for available appointment slots based on user preferences (e.g., date, location).
Slot Selection: Automatically selects and books the best available appointment slot.
Error Handling: Identifies and handles common website errors or issues during the process.
Notification System: Alerts users once an appointment is successfully booked or if further actions are needed.
Current Status

I'm seeking help to complete it. If you're knowledgeable about any of the following topics, your support would be greatly appreciated:

Running bots on a VPS with a Windows VM: Guidance on setting up and running the bot in such environments.
